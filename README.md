# Toy Redis

This is my Rust implementation for the ["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Requirements

1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.88)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented in
   `src/main.rs`. This command compiles your Rust project, so it might be slow
   the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
